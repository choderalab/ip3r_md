# Equilibration

This directory contains simulation inputs, scripts, and other files generated by CHARMMGUI Solution Builder. 

To run energy minimization and equilibration:

1. Download CHARMM topology and parameter files from https://charmm-gui.org/?doc=toppar into a directory called `Toppar`. Ensure that that this directory is pointed to by `toppar.str`. For systems with bound ligands, copy the contents of the subdirectory named for the respective ligand into `Toppar`. For example, for the wild-type ATP-bound system, copy the contents of `/ip3r_md/3equilibration/ATP-WT/atp/` into `Toppar`. 
2. Run `run_equil` for the respective system as a shell script. This will initiate `openmm_run.py`, so ensure that the proper dependencies are installed.
